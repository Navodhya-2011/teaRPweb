                          <b>Tea Plant Vitality Advisor: </b> The first step involves collecting extensive image data of tea plants from various growth stages and health conditions. Machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), will be trained to analyze these images and identify plant health issues. The system will provide actionable insights and precise fertilizer recommendations to optimize plant growth and yield. The backend will be developed using Flask, while the frontend will utilize React for an intuitive user interface.

                          <b>Predicting Factory Tea Leaf Yield: </b> Historical data on tea leaf yields, weather conditions, and other relevant variables will be collected and preprocessed. Machine learning algorithms, including time-series forecasting models like SARIMA and XGBoost, will be used to develop a predictive model. This model will forecast daily tea leaf yields, enabling efficient resource allocation and optimized withering process management. The predictions will be integrated into a web application for real-time decision-making support.

                          <b>Automated Tea Leaves Categorization: </b> High-resolution images of tea leaves will be collected and labeled for quality categories. Advanced image processing techniques using computer vision and machine learning will be applied to automate the sorting process. A model based on deep learning algorithms such as Mask R-CNN will be developed to classify leaves into quality categories accurately. This system will significantly reduce labor costs and improve consistency in tea quality.
